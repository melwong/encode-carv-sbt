We are submitting under topic #3 - Interoperable display of gamer's achievements (SBTs, CARV score, in-game badges etc.) to web2.
 
## contract folder
Contains the Soulbound Token (SBT) smart contract (ERC721). Here's a [demo video](https://youtu.be/PZKISqQGbVQ) that demonstrates how our SBT token works. It enables the contract owner to mint and transfer the token to a user but prevents wallet holder to transfer it out, hence soulbound. But wallet holder could burn it if they wish

## gamipress folder
Contains the code of the plugin that we used to excute the achievements feature. This plugin is part of a larger platform, thus cannot run independently.
